# hawk_eye_notify
Hawk_eye_notify is a file watching framework designed to do a job whenever an
event happens in the directory being watched.

To use this tool, there are three required arguments that must be supplied:
   1. A directory to watch - watches the directory and any directory in it
   2. A unique name for running process - used to name the log and pid files
   3. The action that should occur when something happens in the watched dir

If running it in a seperate directory from the conf then that path
need to be specified as well.

Templates need to be in their own directory, specified in the config file

When this application is started, it will create a <unique_name>.pid file in /tmp.
This pid file contains the process ID for the running daemon, which can be
terminated using the 'Kill' command. Note: killing it this way does not remove the pid
file, it will have to be removed manually.

Once it detects a file, it will log the steps it takes in the log file and
attempt to email it out using settings found in the conf file.

This tool can still hard crash and not really say why, so check the log
file and see if it's complete. Right now, it will end with a 'Email sent' line.
Also, if the pid file is missing, odds are it crashed.

In order for it to process a log, it must contain all of the 'expected_fields'
found in the conf. 'Source' should always be a part of that list.
